            <p class="main-text"> Long ago, in The Lands Between, Queen Marika became a vessel for the Elden Ring. And so, in the name of the Erdtree, Marika conquered the Lands with the aid of her husband Godfrey — a mighty warrior and first Elden Lord — who fought alongside his warriors in the name of the Queen until his very last worthy enemy was defeated and Marika's reign was absolute.

Marika removed the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring and commanded her loyal shadow, Maliketh, to seal it away. Thus, she and everyone blessed by her Grace would live forever, granting her the title of Queen Marika the Eternal. However, this very same Grace was taken away from Godfrey and his army, whom she instructed to wage war and die abroad, with the promise that life and Grace would be returned to them when needed.

All those who were stripped of their Grace, as well as their descendants, became known as the Tarnished. True to Marika's promise, their Grace was returned to them after their deaths, and they were called back to the Lands Between to repair the shattered Elden Ring.</p>
